Creates a linear regression mapping amount of CO2 burned to temperature rise. This modifies the projection of global warming by 2100, based on what % of energy is renewable by 2050. It increases energy requirements by 50% between 2020-2050, reflecting the increase in energy consumption as more countries have a higher standard of living.
